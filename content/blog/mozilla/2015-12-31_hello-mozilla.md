## Hello Mozilla!

Hello world! And in advance, happy new year!

I am going to try to blog more about my work at Mozilla, and this will happen
in this new `mozilla` category. You can expect technical posts about
SpiderMonkey (the JS virtual machine implementation in Mozilla Firefox),
OdinMonkey / asm.js, WebAssembly (wasm), and all things Mozilla in this
category.

Feel free to reach me out via [twitter](https://twitter.com/bnjbvr), and see you
soon!
