Slug: about-me

I am a Compiler Engineer at Mozilla Corporation, working on implementing the JavaScript virtual machine, including the just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation engines. I have been adding features to the extraordinarily optimizable subset of JavaScript, known as asm.js (support of the float32 type, SIMD.js), helping to make them really fast in plain JS as well. My current goal is to get asm.js performance even closer to native. On my spare time, I implement open-source web services that can be self-hosted, to give back control and data ownership to users.
